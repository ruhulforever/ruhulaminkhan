A project on "Rastriya Krishi Vikash Yojana STW/LLP 2011"

The project work is initiated as an academic task for the fulfillment of MCA final project. This minor effort is the outcome of immense interest of officials from “The Office of The Executive Engineer (Agri), Sonitpur, Assam”.

The main intent of this project is to automate the billing regarding the Government scheme RKVY STW/LLP. And a quick synopsis of the system to produce in case of RTI (Right To Information) issues.

Thanking You,
